# OneLib - A Responsive E-commerce Site

OneLib started as a college project. But once I saw the potential for improvement being extremely big, I decided to turn it into a full blown e-commerce website demo.
 
OneLib is a demo for an online marketplace for buying e-books with a focus on speed and reliability.

It's design is heavily inspired from Youtuber [Tech2etc's](https://www.youtube.com/c/Tech2etc) design and I've modified bits here and there to make it stand out.
